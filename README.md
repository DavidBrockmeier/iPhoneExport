# iPhoneExport
alows export of call history and SMS history to CSV from iTunes backup

This is a .Net console application that reads data backed up by iTunes to create two CSV files.

The outputs can be directly opened using excel for any purpose afterward.

For those who would only like the binary: https://github.com/szsz/iPhoneExport/raw/master/Release.zip
Unzip to some folder, then start the application. A SMS.csv and a call.csv file will appear next to the executable.
